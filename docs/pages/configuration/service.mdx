title: Service (Internal Traffic)
sidebar_label: service
---

In short, there are three things you need to know:

1. Containers in the same component will be started within a Kubernetes pod which allows these containers to communicate via `localhost`.
2. If you want containers to communicate across components (cluster-internal traffic), you need to define services for these components.
3. If you want to connect a domain to a service (external internet traffic), you need to [configure an ingress for this service](../configuration/ingress.mdx).

To allow other containers to access this component within the cluster-internal network (2.), you can configure the `service` section for the component:
```yaml
containers:
- image: dscr.io/${DEVSPACE_USERNAME}/database
service:
  ports:
  - port: 3000
```
Now, the component is accessible via:
```bash
[HELM_RELEASE_NAME]:3000    # e.g. database:3000
```


## `ports`
The `ports` option is mandatory and expects an array of port definitions.


### `port`
The `port` option is mandatory and expect an integer with a port number. The service will be available on this port.


### `containerPort`
The `containerPort` option is optional and tells the service to forward the traffic from the service port (defined in `port`) to a different `containerPort` of a pod.

#### Default for `containerPort`
```yaml
containerPort: [same as `port` option]
```

### `name`
The `name` option is optional and allows you to customize the name of the port.

#### Default for `name`
By default the port name will be "port-0", "port-1" etc.

```yaml
name: port-0
```

### `nodePort`
The `nodePort` option is optional and tells the service to expose the service at a static node port.
Applicable to `NodePort` service `type`.


### `protocol`
The `protocol` option is optional and expects a string that defines the network protocol for this service port.

#### Default for `protocol`
```yaml
protocol: TCP
```


## `type`
The `type` option is optional and expects a string that defines the type of the service.

#### Default for `type`
```yaml
type: ClusterIP
```


## `externalIPs`
The `externalIPs` option is optional and expects an array of IP addresses for the service.


## `name`
The `name` option is optional and expects a string that defines the name of the service.

#### Default for `name`
```yaml
name: [HELM_RELEASE_NAME]
```


## `labels`
The `labels` option is optional and expects an array of additional Kubernetes labels for the service.


## `annotations`
The `annotations` option is optional and expects an array of additional Kubernetes annotations for the service.
