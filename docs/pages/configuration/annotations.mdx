title: Pod Annotations
sidebar_label: annotations
---

The `annotations` option expects a map with Kubernetes annotations. 

By default, the component chart sets a couple of annotations following the best practices described in the Kubernetes documentation:
- `helm.sh/chart: component-chart-vX.Y.Z`

:::note
You can specify additional annotations using the `annotations` option but the default / best practice annotations will still be set for the component.
:::

All additional annotations will be added to the pods of this component as well as to your Deployments or StatefulSets used to create the pods.

#### Default Value For `annotations`
```yaml
annotations: []
```

#### Example: Additional Annotations
```yaml
containers:
- image: john/appbackend
annotations:
  annotation1: annotation-value-1
  annotation2: annotation-value-2
```
